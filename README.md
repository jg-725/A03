Hello user, 

In this concise tutorial, you'll find a guide to be able to dive into the world of Git and Github.
The first step is composed of installing the necessary programs and setting up an account.
Downloading GIT from https://git-scm.com/downloads and WebStorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/students 
Then you would create a Github account by going to https://github/join
The second step would be to connect Github with WebStorm by going to system preferences then Version Control-Git and 
making sure the path reads C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe.
Third step is to login to Github with the account just created and once we are in, you will create a repository.
Next you will click the + sign on the upper right corner and click "New Repository", create a name, then making the repository public and adding the readme file.
The fourth step is to open WebStorm and create a new project, then a new HTML 5 file.
Fifth step will be to click VCS and Import into Version Control, enter Github repository name and finally entering local path name.
A dialog box letting you Add to Git will appear and you will click Add, this will add to local file system.
Committing your changes a crucial step to allow your file to appear on Github.
Once in Github, it is ideal to double check our repository name in the Settings tab.
Lastly you will want to remain in the Settings tab and scroll down to Github Pages and find Source and make sure you choose master branch.
